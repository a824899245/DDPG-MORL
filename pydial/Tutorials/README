The Jupyter Notebook App is a server-client application that allows editing and running
notebook documents via a web browser. However, no internet access is required.

# INSTALLATION
It is recommended to install Jupyter through Anaconda or conda as they install this package by default.
Alternatively just run:
pip install jupyter

# RUNNING
To open jupyter run in terminal (cd to cued-pydial before):
$jupyter notebook

This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard,
a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.
Navigate to Tutorials folder to see available notebooks.

To open on of them just click on it.  You can run the notebook document step-by-step
(one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter. For more advanced options just press "h".
