Often dialogue systems are deployed in a noisy setting, where background noise and diverse user populations can result in high speech recognition error rates. Thus, SLU systems operate on the top $k$ hypotheses output by the speech recogniser and this creates additional challenges for effective transformation of spoken utterances to dialogue acts. Let's look at the illustrative procedure:"
