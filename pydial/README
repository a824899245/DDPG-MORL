Welcome to PyDial: the CUED Python Statistical Dialog System (V1.0)
==================================================================

If you are reading this you have probably already downloaded the PyDial repo but if
you havent, do it now:

> git clone https://bitbucket.org/dialoguesystems/pydial.git
> cd pydial

PyDial uses Python 2.7 and has not been tested with other versions. Ensure 
that you use the requirements.txt file to install the appropriate dependencies
via pip. If you do not have pip installed yet first do

> sudo easy_install pip

otherwise exectued directly

> pip install -r requirements.txt

To check that you have a fully functioning system, run the PyDial functional tests

> sh testPyDial

You should see output similar to the following:
